<div class="vspace"></div><h2>The Arcade Blaster Help</h2>
<p>The Arcade Blaster is a new multi-platform application that 
simplifies using Papilio Arcade kit and eliminates the need to directly 
work on HDL sources, which is time-consuming as well as requires some 
external tools and some expertise in VLSI. It runs on both Windows and 
Linux and uses command line tools from various sources.

<div class="vspace"></div><h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Modern VLSI technology has made possible extremely high level of 
integration, allowing entire systems to be integrated into a single 
chip. The FPGA technology even goes one step further making this chip 
reprogrammable with different hardware every time. The Arcade Blaster 
uses pre-built FPGA bitstreams that implement all the hardware circuitry
 on the arcade control boards of late 70s and 80s. These bitstreams do 
not contain any actual game code, but provide all the hardware that a 
game needs to run. One such hardware can run a number of games since 
game developers reused their hardware platforms for different games.
</p>
<div class="vspace"></div><div><img src="index_files/arcadeintegration.png" alt="" title=""></div>
<p class="vspace">The FPGA device on the Papilio boards needs to be 
programmed with  bitstream in order to work. A bitstream is basically a 
series of bits that configures the FPGA to create the hardware designed 
into the bitstream which is, for all intents and purposes, the same 
hardware used originally to run the arcade game. To play a game, all you
 need is to select a game and press [Load Game] button, here is what the
 Arcade Blaster does for you:
</p>
<p class="vspace">1. Consolidate parts of ROM and convert them to mem files compatible with hardware bitfile.<br>2. Merge the mem files into hardware bitfile to produce a single file that represents a fully programmed Arcade board.<br>3. Writes this final bitfile to the Papilio FPGA board
</p>
<p class="vspace">and within a few seconds you are ready to play the game!
</p>
<div class="vspace"></div><h3>How to use the Papilio Arcade Kit?</h3>
<p>The Papilio Arcade Kit consists two boards, the Papilio FPGA board 
(e.g. Papilio One 500k Spartan 3E board) and the Arcade MegaWing. The 
FPGA board implements actual hardware required for the game, while the 
Arcade MegaWing provides physical interfaces to connect to devices like 
the VGA monitor, stereo speakers, joysticks, keyboard and mouse.
</p>
<p class="vspace">The Papilio FPGA board connects to the PCB with a standard 5-pin mini USB female to B-type male cable.
</p>
<p class="vspace"><a name="application" id="application"></a>
</p><h3>The Application</h3>
<p>The default GUI for Arcade Blaster application is a gamepad that has 
controls to select and load a game, look for new games and provide help 
for installed games.
</p>
<div class="vspace"></div><div><img src="index_files/gamepadgui.png" alt="" title=""></div>
<p class="vspace">The different parts of this gamepad interface are as follows:
</p>
<div class="vspace"></div><ul><li><strong>Game list box</strong>: This list shows all the games that can be played on the Arcade kit. The game logo in the middle indicates the selected game.
<div class="vspace"></div></li><li><strong>Up/Dn buttons</strong>: Use these buttons to scroll through the list of playable games
<div class="vspace"></div></li><li><strong>Game Screenshot</strong>: Shows a small screenshot of the game, gives you an idea what the game looks like.
<div class="vspace"></div></li><li><strong>Load Game button</strong>: If you like the game you are looking at in the screenshot, it this button and the application will load it into the FPGA.
<div class="vspace"></div></li><li><strong>Updates button</strong>: This
 button invokes a dialog box to check for updates and lets you add 
support for any new games that may have been added to our list since you
 last updated.
<div class="vspace"></div></li><li><strong>How to play button</strong>: 
This button will show you a small guide to the selected game, giving a 
brief background, the story line and the controls. This is not as 
comprehensive as online help, but will give you an idea as to how to 
play the game.
<div class="vspace"></div></li><li><strong>Install Game button</strong>:
 You can install the ROM files for a game that is supported by the 
application. You simply need to provide it the zip file, the application
 will take care of figuring out which game it contains and will install 
it properly. You can then select it and play.
<div class="vspace"></div></li><li><strong>Settings button</strong>: 
This button invokes a dialog box that lets you specify which board, 
joystick and other items you are using so that application will use 
correct files and provide you the right information on playing the 
games.
<div class="vspace"></div></li><li><strong>Help button</strong>: Help (with the question mark) button opens the local copy of this file in the browser.
<div class="vspace"></div></li><li><strong>Exit button</strong>: This button (with cross in a circle on top center) disconnects the gamepad i.e. closes the application.
</li></ul><p class="vspace">You can also use following keystrokes to invoke some of the commands:
</p>
<div class="vspace"></div>
<table border="1" cellpadding="1"><tbody>
<tr><td align="center"><b>Keystroke</b></td><td align="center"><b>Command</b></td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">Up arrow</td><td align="center">Next Game</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">Down arrow</td><td align="center">Previous Game</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">F1</td><td align="center">Help</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">F5</td><td align="center">Load Game</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">'?' or '/'</td><td align="center">How to play game</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p class="vspace"><a name="loadgame" id="loadgame"></a>
</p><h3>Loading a game</h3>
<p>Loading a game into the FPGA is very simple. Using [Up] and [Dn] 
buttons, browse through the list of installed games. The current game 
will be seen in the list box and its screenshot in the center of the 
gamepad window. When your favorite game is selected, hit the [Load Game]
 button. The Arcade Blaster application will process the game's ROM 
files, put them into the relevent hardware bitfile and write it into the
 FPGA device on your Papilio Arcde kit.
</p>
<p class="vspace">Within 2 to 3 seconds, the game should start.
</p>
<div class="vspace"></div><h3>How to play help</h3>
<p>This button will display a brief description of the game, how to use 
the joystick, the keyboard and cursor keys on the Arcade Megawing or 
invoke coin play.
</p>
<p class="vspace"><a name="installnew" id="installnew"></a>
</p><h3>Installing a new game</h3>
<p>Installing a game is very easy. All you have to do hit [Install Game]
 button and provide the zip file containing game ROMs to the 
application. The application will look for any matching files in the 
database of supported games. If a match is found, it will install the 
ROM files into the application folder and add the game to the game list 
box. You can now select the game, see its screenshot, and load it to the
 FPGA.
</p>
<p class="vspace"><a name="updategames" id="updategames"></a>
</p><h3>Looking for new game support updates</h3>
<p>The Arcade Blaster application maintains a database of supported 
games, various hardware architectures required for the games and 
information about Papilio boards they would run on. This support keeps 
increasing on a regular basis, so it is a good idea to check for updates
 once in a while. Clicking on [Updates] invokes the following dialog 
box.
</p>
<div class="vspace"></div><div><img src="index_files/UpdateDialog.png" alt="" title=""></div>
<p class="vspace">The application checks for updates online and displays
 the list of games in its database and their support status. New games 
that are not in its local database can be marked for update. It also 
shows whether a game has its support files present, and also whether it 
has all its ROM files installed. The icons in the games list 
Support/Installed columns are:
</p>
<div class="vspace"></div>
<table border="0" cellpadding="5"><tbody><tr><td><img src="index_files/game_checkbox.png" alt="" title=""></td><td>Game support files are available for download</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="index_files/game_supported.png" alt="" title=""></td><td>Game is already supported by the application</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="index_files/game_installed.png" alt="" title=""></td><td>Game is already installed and ready to play</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="index_files/game_cantplay.png" alt="" title=""></td><td>This game cannot be played because of unavailable hardware or other resources</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p class="vspace">Any game with checkbox in support column can be marked
 to update. This will download and install the files required to play 
the game, which will be used when the user provides appropriate ROM 
files. Only games that are supported by the application can be installed
 and played.
</p>
<div class="vspace"></div><h3>Settings</h3>
<p>The Settings dialogbox allows you to select your FPGA board and 
joystick. This helps the application to select the correct files to 
compose the game for your hardware.
</p>
<div class="vspace"></div><h3>Support</h3>
<p>Help is always available on pressing the F1 key in the application<br>For any queries, bug reports or feature requests please make a post on <a class="urllink" href="http://www.gadgetfactory.net/gadgetforum/index.php?board=18.0" title="" rel="nofollow">Papilio Arcade forum</a>
